# Dual Wielding Unbound
(If you're wondering, the mod id is `dual_wielding` and not `dual_wielding_unbound`.)

Every Dual Wielding mod that exists decided that it was too hard to use one
keybind to attack. Why does everyone use the use key for the offhand? I don't know.

This mod fixes all of that. Now, when pressing attack, you will attack.

If the mainhand is empty, the offhand will perform the attack. Otherwise,
the hand with the higher attack progress will perform the attack.

Non-entity attacking actions (i.e. block breaking) are unsupported.
